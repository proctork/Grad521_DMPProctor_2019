# Data description
This project will require data both from field experiments and from public databases. Running the crop model requires a variety of inputs including: 1) information about soil characteristics, soil texture, clay percent; 2) information about the height of the groundwater table; 3) climate data, minimum and maximum temperature, daily precipitation, incoming radiation, atmospheric CO2 levels, latitude for calculation of solar radiation; 4) Individual crop parameters, planting date, degree days to maturity, duration of each crop growth stage, temperature range for growth, minimum and maximum rooting depth, water productivity. Water and salinity stress thresholds, minimum and maximum stomatal conductance rates, 5) Crop market values for economic assessment, market value for solar produced energy

For the field experiments, values will be collected experimentally. For the region wide assessment values for databases 1, 2, 3, & 5 will be collected from online repositories , and values for database 4 will come from a combination of literature and the results of field experiments.


# Roles and responsibilities
The general Data management rules are listed below. 
Data Collection Field experiments: Me
Archiving field data: Grad Student Me
Instrumentation Maintenance: Me
Data Collection from online repositories: Me
Data Analysis/organization to prepare it for Model: Me
Model Data Generation: Me
Archiving and Preservation: Me + P.I. (I will be responsible for organizing all of my results into an easy to access format which I will then give to me PI and he will ensure it is preserved)

# Data standards and metadata
There are 5 different types of data utilized in this project as shown above in the Data Description section. 
All data will be stored using the Agricultural Metadata Element Set(AgMES) Standard 
Information regarding the soil characteristics and initial ground water table will be stored in the form of an ArcGIS shape file, using the spatial areas described by the gSSURGO database. Each area will constitue a row in tabular format and will have information regarding the different soil characteristics for the area. 
Field climate data will be collected using climate stations (exact model and number of stations TBD) samples are collected semi-continuously and the data will be downloaded once per week and transffered to a desktop harddrive in csv format.
Crop measurements will be collected manually and stored in csv format.
Market values will be collected from online repositores (exact repository and format TBD) 

All data listed above will be stored on the OSU Biological and Ecological Engineering (BEE) server using version control via TortoiseSVN software

No data listed above contains personally sensitive information




# Storage and security
Using the university’s data classification system, sensitive data is data which should not be openly disclosed because it holds people’s personal, private information. For example, student data, or common identifiers like DOB. My research will not work with any sensitive data. There are no human subjects and a large portion of the data is publicly available (weather data, soil data from USGS, crop market prices)
