# Data Management Plan for Modeling Agrivoltaic Systems in the state of Oregon

# Research Description
My research looks at Agrivoltaic systems, systems which incorporate agricultural and photovoltaic production by growing crops beneath solar panels. This type of system has been shown to have multiple benefits including increased crop yields, reduced water demand, and improved efficiency of solar panels (evapotranspiration from crops cools panels, cooler panels have higher efficiency). The research question has two parts, 1) Are current crop growth models accurate for modeling crop growth in agrivoltaic systems, if not what changes must be made to make them accurate? 2) Which areas of Oregon are best suited for agrivoltaic systems? 
Field experiments will be used to calibrate and validate crop models. Once crop models work well ,they will be incorporated into a regional scale integrated model which considers crop yield and water use along with the market value of the crops and energy to identify the most suitable areas within the state of Oregon.
